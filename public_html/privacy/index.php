	<h1> Privacy Policy</h1>
    <p>This privacy policy has been compiled to better serve those who are concerned with how their &#39;Personally Identifiable Information&#39; (PII) is being used online. PII, as used in US privacy law and information security, is information that can be used on its own or with other information to identify, contact, or locate a single person, or to identify an individual in context. Please read our privacy policy carefully to get a clear understanding of how we collect, use, protect or otherwise handle your Personally Identifiable Information in accordance with our website.</p>

    <h3>What personal information do we collect from the people that visit our website?</h3>

    <p>When registering on our site, you may be asked to enter your name and email address, as well as a password for your account. Question sets you have created are stored on our server.</p>

    <h3>How do we use your information?</h3>

    <p>Your information is only used to validate logins, and so we may contact you in case of a data breach. Please note that all question sets submitted for approval <b>are read by site administrators and will be made public if/when they are accepted. Question sets will be approved or rejected at our own discretion.</b></p>

    <h3>How do we protect visitor information?</h3>

    <p>Your personal information is contained behind secured networks and is only accessible by a limited number of persons who have special access rights to such systems, and are required to keep the information confidential. In addition, all sensitive information you supply is encrypted via Secure Socket Layer (SSL) technology.</p>

    <h3>Do we use &#39;cookies&#39;?</h3>

    <p>Yes. Cookies are small files that a site or its service provider transfers to your computer&#39;s hard drive through your Web browser (if you allow) that enables the site&#39;s or service provider&#39;s systems to recognize your browser and capture and remember certain information. For instance, we use cookies to remember if you have logged in on a given device.</p>

    <p>You can choose to have your computer warn you each time a cookie is being sent, or you can choose to turn off all cookies. You do this through your browser settings. Each browser is a little different, so look at your browser&#39;s Help menu to learn the correct way to modify your cookies.</p>

    <p>If you disable cookies, you will not be able to log in to ExSciTecH.</p>

    <h3>Third Party Disclosure</h3>

    <p>We do not sell, trade, or otherwise transfer to outside parties your personally identifiable information.</p>

    <h3>Third party links</h3>

    <p>We do not include or offer third party products or services on our website.</p>

    <h3>Google Analytics</h3>

    <p>We do not use advertisements on this site, but we do use Google Analytics to track page views. Google Analytic&#39;s terms of service can be found <a href="http://www.google.com/analytics/terms/us.html">here</a>. </p>

    <h3>California Online Privacy Protection Act</h3>

    <p>CalOPPA is the first state law in the nation to require commercial websites and online services to post a privacy policy. The law&#39;s reach stretches well beyond California to require a person or company in the United States (and conceivably the world) that operates websites collecting personally identifiable information from California consumers to post a conspicuous privacy policy on its website stating exactly the information being collected and those individuals with whom it is being shared, and to comply with this policy. See more at <a href="http://consumercal.org/california-online-privacy-protection-act-caloppa/">here</a>.</p>

    <p>According to CalOPPA we agree to the following:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Users can visit our site anonymously</li>
        <li>Once this privacy policy is created, we will add a link to it on our home page, or as a minimum on the first significant page after entering our website.</li>
        <li>Our Privacy Policy link includes the word &#39;Privacy&#39;, and can be easily be found on the page specified above.</li>
        <li>Users will be notified of any privacy policy changes on our Privacy Policy Page</li>
        <li>Users are able to change their password on their account page, or contact us to make other changes.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>How does our site handle do not track signals?</h3>
    <p>We do not currently handle Do Not Track signals, however, the only &quot;tracking&quot; done is through Google Analytics (anonymously), as mentioned above.</p>

    <h3>Does our site allow third party behavioral tracking?</h3>
    <p>We do not allow third party behavioral tracking.</p>

    <h3>COPPA (Children Online Privacy Protection Act)</h3>

    <p>When it comes to the collection of personal information from children under 13, the Children&#39;s Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA) puts parents in control. The Federal Trade Commission, the nation&#39;s consumer protection agency, enforces the COPPA Rule, which spells out what operators of websites and online services must do to protect children&#39;s privacy and safety online.</p>

    <p>We do not specifically market to children under 13.</p>

    <h3>Fair Information Practices</h3>

    <p>The Fair Information Practices Principles form the backbone of privacy law in the United States and the concepts they include have played a significant role in the development of data protection laws around the globe. Understanding the Fair Information Practice Principles and how they should be implemented is critical to comply with the various privacy laws that protect personal information.</p>

    <p>In order to be in line with Fair Information Practices we will notify the users via email within 3 business days if a data breach should occur.</p>

    <p>We also agree to the individual redress principle, which requires that individuals have a right to pursue legally enforceable rights against data collectors and processors who fail to adhere to the law. This principle requires not only that individuals have enforceable rights against data users, but also that individuals have recourse to courts or a government agency to investigate and/or prosecute non-compliance by data processors.
